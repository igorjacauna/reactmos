Since the `routes` function in the `module.config.ts` file can be asynchronous, it is necessary to display something while the application loads the routes and other configurations.

By default, Reactmos shows a simple loading screen, which you can override by creating an HTML file that will be displayed inside the `div` with `id="root"`.

The only requirement is that the HTML file must be named `loading.html` and placed at the root of the project.

```html [loading.html]
<div>
  Loading...
</div>
```
