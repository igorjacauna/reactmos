`extends` is a feature that allows your application to "inherit" functionality from other modules.

This enables you to distribute and organize your entire application in a fully modular way.

You can simply have a single module that extends all the other modules required by your application.

## How create a module

Just run

```bash
pnpm create reactmos main-module
```

## How extends

You can extend a module by specifying it in the `module.config.ts` file.

```ts
export default {
  moduleName: 'main-module',
  extends: [
    'auth-module', // You can a use a published module
    '../blog-module' // You can use a relative path to another module
  ]
}
```

::tip
You can extend a module published in a registry, or simply use a relative path to the module you want to extend.

::warning
When using a relative path, you must have the dependencies of the extended module installed in your project.

## What is inherit

The main thing inherited from extended modules is their routes. Functions, methods, components, and other values can be shared through the `extras` option in `module.config.ts` and accessed using the `getExtras` helper function. You can see how [here](/features/extra-configs)
