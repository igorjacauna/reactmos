Routes are defined as an function that returns a array of `RouteObject` objects, a type provided by `react-router` for configuring paths, 

So, you have full flexibility to define your routes exactly as you would with the [useRoutes](https://api.reactrouter.com/v7/functions/react_router.useRoutes.html) hook from react-router.

```ts [module.config.tsx]
export default {
  ...,
  routes() {
    return [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Dashboard />,
        children: [
          {
            path: "messages",
            element: <DashboardMessages />,
          },
          { path: "tasks", element: <DashboardTasks /> },
        ],
      },
      { path: "team", element: <AboutPage /> },
    ]
  }
}
```

It can be an asynchronous function, allowing you to leverage `async/await` for tasks such as fetching data or performing other asynchronous operations before returns the routes.

```ts [module.config.tsx]
export default {
  ...,
  async routes() {
    const childrenAsync = await makeSomething();
    return [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Dashboard />,
        children: childrenAsync,
      },
      { path: "team", element: <AboutPage /> },
    ]
  }
}
```
