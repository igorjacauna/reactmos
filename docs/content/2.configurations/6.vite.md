You can augment or override the Vite configuration by creating a `vite.config.ts` file in the projectâ€™s root directory. This file should reside at the root level, not inside `src/`.

::warning
Be cautious when modifying the Vite configuration, as improper changes can break the Reactmos run. Use this feature carefully.
::

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import somePlugin from 'vite-some-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [somePlugin()]
})
```
