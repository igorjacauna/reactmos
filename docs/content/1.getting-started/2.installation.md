## Quick Start

You can start a fresh new project with:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm create reactmos my-module
```

or create a new project with:

1. Install `reactmos`: `pnpm add reactmos`
2. Add `@reactmos/cli` as development dependency: `pnpm add -D @reactmos/cli`
3. Add the scripts to `package.json`:
```json
"dev": "reactmox dev",
"build": "reactmox build"
```
4. Create a configuration file in `src/module.config.ts`
```ts
export default {
  moduleName: 'my-module'
}
```

That's it! You can now start writing your application!
